		<h1>FEATURED PROJECTS</h1>
		<p>Hey! I'm Henry and I like to make stuff! I'm a bit of a jack of all trades and a master of none, but I really enjoy learning new skills and trying my best to create things worth consuming! Here are some projects I'm rather proud of!</p>

					<h1 class="featuredItemTitle">Sun Clock</h1>
					<p>The <em>Sun Clock</em> project, which started simply as a final project for <em>Object</em> last semester, quickly turned into one of my all-time favorites. A group project with Quynh Tran and Nini Papunashvili, this piece of wall decor was my first venture into internet-enabled electronics as well as aesthetic physical fabrication.</p>
					<p>At its core, the electronics are run by an <em>Adafruit Feather Huzzah</em>, which communicates via <em>AdafruitIO</em> to retrieve time data as well as sunrise and sunset data. Armed with this information, the array of <em>NeoPixels</em> can display various representations of the time and day/night cycle. It also has such features as a solid-color accent light and "party mode."</p>
					<p>I am really proud of this project not because it changes anyone's life or accomplishes an incredible feat, but because I made it with my hands and it's pretty enough to hang in my apartment. It required a lot of time, patience and problem solving, but I learned a lot along the way!</p>

					<h1 class="featuredItemTitle">"The Dap"</h1>
					<p>This personal project started in an attempt to jump onto the NFT craze train and make a lot of money, but I came up short on time and marketing skills.</p>
					<p><em>The Dap</em> was destined to be a randomly generated series of 10,000 renders, each depicting the same gentleman preparing to dap up an off-screen friend. Each render would depict a unique combination of clothing, wall art, accessories and body color. Material rarity in the collection made some more desirable than others.</p>
					<p>This was the goal, and so I started to design. I drew inspiration for my character model from a tool called <em>Character Creator</em>, and designed all of the clothing from scratch in a program called <em>Marvelous Designer</em>. I began to design materials and lighting in <em>Blender</em>, and eventually began to achieve renders that I was happy with. I started learning a python scripting library for <em>Blender</em> to facilitate the random generation and rendering of the combinations, and I started to learn <em>Solidity</em>, a language I would use to write smart contracts on the <em>Ethereum</em> blockchain.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, I underestimated the amount of work that I was signing up for, and overestimated both my motivation and the free time I'd have after school and my job took priority.</p>
					<p>The reason I still have decided to put this project on display here is because of how much I learned and how far I came in a project I truly had no business undertaking. Fashion design, character modeling and everything to do with blockchain technologies were all far outside my capabilities when I started, but I tried hard and put time into learning, and I'm happy with the results that I achieved.</p>
