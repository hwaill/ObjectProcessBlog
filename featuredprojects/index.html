		<h1>FEATURED PROJECTS</h1>
		<p>Hey! I'm Henry and I like to make stuff! I'm a bit of a jack of all trades and a master of none, but I really enjoy learning new skills and trying my best to create things worth consuming! Here are some projects I'm rather proud of!</p>

					<h1 class="featuredItemTitle">Sun Clock</h1>
					<p>The <em>Sun Clock</em> project, which started simply as a final project for <em>Object</em> last semester, quickly turned into one of my all-time favorites. A group project with Quynh Tran and Nini Papunashvili, this piece of wall decor was my first venture into internet-enabled electronics as well as aesthetic physical fabrication.</p>
					<p>At its core, the electronics are run by an <em>Adafruit Feather Huzzah</em>, which communicates via <em>AdafruitIO</em> to retrieve time data as well as sunrise and sunset data. Armed with this information, the array of <em>NeoPixels</em> can display various representations of the time and day/night cycle. It also has such features as a solid-color accent light and "party mode."</p>
					<p>I am really proud of this project not because it changes anyone's life or accomplishes an incredible feat, but because I made it with my hands and it's pretty enough to hang in my apartment. It required a lot of time, patience and problem solving, but I learned a lot along the way!</p>

					<h1 class="featuredItemTitle">"The Dap"</h1>
					<p>This personal project started in an attempt to jump onto the NFT craze train and make a lot of money, but I came up short on time and marketing skills.</p>
					<p><em>The Dap</em> was destined to be a randomly generated series of 10,000 renders, each depicting the same gentleman preparing to dap up an off-screen friend. Each render would depict a unique combination of clothing, wall art, accessories and body color. Material rarity in the collection made some more desirable than others.</p>
					<p>This was the goal, and so I started to design. I drew inspiration for my character model from a tool called <em>Character Creator</em>, and designed all of the clothing from scratch in a program called <em>Marvelous Designer</em>. I began to design materials and lighting in <em>Blender</em>, and eventually began to achieve renders that I was happy with. I started learning a python scripting library for <em>Blender</em> to facilitate the random generation and rendering of the combinations, and I started to learn <em>Solidity</em>, a language I would use to write smart contracts on the <em>Ethereum</em> blockchain.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, I underestimated the amount of work that I was signing up for, and overestimated both my motivation and the free time I'd have after school and my job took priority.</p>
					<p>The reason I still have decided to put this project on display here is because of how much I learned and how far I came in a project I truly had no business undertaking. Fashion design, character modeling and everything to do with blockchain technologies were all far outside my capabilities when I started, but I tried hard and put time into learning, and I'm happy with the results that I achieved.</p>

					<h1 class="featuredItemTitle">Controller Overlays for Streamers</h1>
					<p>A long-term project of mine that stemmed out of personal necessity was my venture into professional, freelance design work, when I made custom "controller overlays" for gaming streamers.</p>
					<p>I'm not ashamed to admit that, during COVID, loneliness and boredom drove me to try streaming my favorite videogame, <em>Rocket League</em>. <em>Rocket League</em> is a game where you play soccer with flying cars, in essence, but the practice and finesse required to achieve a high level is impressive. Many streamers choose to show what their hands are doing with the controller by showing a virtual one on screen, so that their viewers can both better understand the mechanics of the game and feel a more personal connection, in some ways.</p>
					<p>I wanted a controller overlay and I wanted to make it my own, so I customized the design template to match my stream's aesthetic. It was terrible at first, of course, but rendition after rendition improved the results. After upgrading controllers to a new model, I found that there was no templates for the new model to use as a jumping off point. I made my own templates, and they were <em>good</em>. I wrote programs in <em>Processinig</em> to create realistic shadows and wrote tools to help warp designs to create accurate 3D perspective. I began creating high resolution animations and other features that were new to the market, and streamlined the installation process to make using my designs as easy as possible.</p>
					<p>Alongside the technical improvements I made and design skills I developed, I was also successfully marketing my design services to other streamers. Quickly, I became the go-to guy for people looking for controller overlays, nearly worldwide. Gaming organizations, professional esports players, you name it!</p>
					<p>I am really proud of myself for the work I did and the effort I put into improving my skills. While I am no longer active on the scene, I am happy that I could provide a service for people. I still host all my designs online and many are still used to this day, years later.</p>

					<h1 class="featuredItemTitle">CNC Drawing Machine</h1>
					<p>This project is one that I hold in very high regard. Unlike the others on this page, I didn't create a standalone product with a life that ended when I decided it was done. Instead, I made a <em>tool</em>. In the height of my endeavours creating generative art with <em>Processing</em> and <em>p5.js</em>, I was tired of printers and I was tired of saving images to my computer by the thousands. My interest was piqued when I saw someone on <em>Instagram</em> using an AxiDraw pen plotter, and I decided to challenge myself to make my own.</p>
					<p>The sad truth is that my drawing machine is a little too big to keep out in the apartment all the time, so it lives a lonely, purposeless existence behind some crap in my closet, where it is almost never used. One day it may reawaken. Who knows?</p>
					<p>The construction was made mostly of aluminum extrusions, and a company, <em>OpenBuilds</em>, made it really easy to purchase parts that were designed to work with one another, for the most part. The circuitry for making an arduino control the stepper motors was a custom adventure where I'm sure I made everything more difficult than it had to be, but this was my first time upgrading a project from a breadboard, so I'm happy with the result.</p>
