		<h1 class="postTitle">Lab 3: "I came, I saw, I soldered"</h1>
		<h2 class="postSubtitle">Henry Waill - 2/21/2023</h2>
		<h3 class="postHeader">Description</h3>
		<p class="postText">The lab this week focused on working on more permanent circuits than the ones we've made on the breadboard so far. This lab introduced us to soldering, which involves fusing components together by melting metal connections between them.</p>
		<h3 class="postHeader">Materials</h3>
		<p class="postText">This lab requires many more materials than what we've used so far. Almost everything new has been provided from the BTU.</p>

		<h3 class="postHeader">Part 1: Soldering Setup and Safety</h3>
		<p class="postText">Here's an image of all the tools we'll be using for our soldering:</p>

		<p class="postText">There are a lot of safety precautions we must take when soldering. First, the soldering iron becomes very hot, so it's important to be mindful of how it's handled. Never touch the tip of the iron and only hold the handle. Additionally, the iron should always be kept in its stand. This minimizing the risk of injury and of burning something.</p>
		<p class="postText">Next, it's important to turn on the fume extractor, as the fumes created when soldering can be dangerous to inhale. On a similar note, it's important to wash your hands after soldering and never eat or drink at the station.</p>
		<p class="postText">Finally, it's crucial to wear safety glasses to protect from stray droplets or fumes.</p>
		<h3 class="postHeader">Part 2: Soldering Wires to Protoboard</h3>
		<p class="postText">Let's get to soldering. First we need to tin the iron so that it looks like this:</p>

		<p class="postText">And here are images of stranded and solid-core wires soldered to the protoboard:</p>

		<p class="postText">I don't think I have too much of a preference between soldering stranded and solid wires. They both seemed to work pretty easily, although occasionally, the stranded wire was difficult to thread through the holes of the protoboard without getting snagged.</p>
		<h3 class="postHeader">Part 3: Bridge of Solder</h3>
		<p class="postText">You can see in the next image that this task proved difficult for me. Making solder bridges has never been my forte, and I nearly gave up multiple times. You can see two locations on the protoboard where I failed so many times that the board was burned beyond usefulness. I managed to make the three solder bridges and hope I never have to again.</p>

		<h3 class="postHeader">Part 4: Splicing Wires</h3>
		<p class="postText">Splicing wires was relatively simple, but required some finicking with the helping hands to line up the wires with one another. This didn't take too long, and you can see the results in the images below:</p>

		<h3 class="postHeader">Extra Volt</h3>
		<p class="postText">The <em>Extra Volt</em> this week was a fun one and it's always exciting to put new skills to work. I chose to use the male headers to plug directly into the arduino and forgo using jumper cables for the connection. Because of this, they needed to be soldered to the opposite side of the protoboard than the LED. Here are pictures of the circuit and a video of it in action:</p>
