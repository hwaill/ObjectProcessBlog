		<h2 class="postSubtitle">Henry Waill - 2/21/2023</h2>
		<h3 class="postHeader">Description</h3>
		<p class="postText">The lab this week focused on working on more permanent circuits than the ones we've made on the breadboard so far. This lab introduced us to soldering, which involves fusing components together by melting metal connections between them.</p>
		<h3 class="postHeader">Materials</h3>
		<p class="postText">This lab requires many more materials than what we've used so far. Almost everything new has been provided from the BTU.</p>

		<p class="postText">There are a lot of safety precautions we must take when soldering. First, the soldering iron becomes very hot, so it's important to be mindful of how it's handled. Never touch the tip of the iron and only hold the handle. Additionally, the iron should always be kept in its stand. This minimizing the risk of injury and of burning something.</p>
		<p class="postText">Next, it's important to turn on the fume extractor, as the fumes created when soldering can be dangerous to inhale. On a similar note, it's important to wash your hands after soldering and never eat or drink at the station.</p>
		<p class="postText">Finally, it's crucial to wear safety glasses to protect from stray droplets or fumes.</p>
